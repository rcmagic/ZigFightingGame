** TODO **
- See if deinit() the asset allocators works properly when reloading assets.
- How do we free textures? How can we avoid reloading textures each time? 

- Setup character data that will be used in the collision system.
- Run the hitbox data through the collision system
- Create a collision event structure
- Generated hit events when hitboxes overlap

- Create test hitbox data to test collision system. 
- Test hitbox collision event generation

- Create a bunch of hitbox data for our character
- Create a second character to test hit interactions
- Create an attack action
- Create a reaction action 
- Implement a timeline data structure


- Move the TranslateHitbox function to common.zig
- Implement function for getting active attack boxes offset by the character position.
- Verify what we're doing with the character data in the test "Test clearing out scratch hitbox data each frame"


** TBD **
- Create hit properties struct
- Implement reaction system
- Implement more character states (Attack, Reaction, Jump)
- Support action state variables (action time, hit stop)
- projectiles discussion
- animation discussion
- Make new run-time structure for storing hitboxes for the collision system.

** The Back Burner **
- Look into how to deal with parsing large files with JSON.
- Look into memory allocation tradeoffs for dealing with loading data.
- What do we do about allocated memory inside of deep struct hierarchies such as strings and ArrayLists?
- Support flipped physics (What did I intend with this again?)
