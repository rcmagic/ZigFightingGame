* Principles *
- No OOP.
- Data Oriented
- No deep structures. Not only data, but also code. "Flat"
- Pipelining. Preparing data in stages that stage.
- Determinism. 
- Code isolation for game simulation.
- Split the pipeline into "systems"
- Handles over pointers.
- Store data in "components."


* Code Structure *

Platform Initialization()
Game Loop:
    InputHandling()
    NetworkUpdate()
    GameSimulation()
    {
        CommandBufferUpdate()       // Generate the "commands" which drives character state
        ActionStateMachineUpdate()  // Update what "move" the character currently is in.
        AnimationSystemUpdate()
        CharacterPhysicsUpdate()    // Handle position/velocity/acceleration changes.
        GameCameraUpdate()
        CharacterPushCollision()
        WallUpdate()
        WallCollisionHandling()
        CharacterAttackCollision()  // Processing collisions between attack and vulnerable hitboxes
        ReactionSystemUpdate()      // Transitions characters into reaction states.
        
    }
    StoreGameState()

    VisualCameraUpdate()
    Rendering()


** Action State Machine Data **
- Unique Identifier (Integer/Enum)
- Associated properties for each state (Animation, Hitbox, sounds, hit properties, VFX)
- Custom Transitions (Condition, Target States)

** Action State Machine Processor **
- Handle the state transitions.
- Checks transition conditions of the current state and sets the next state.
- Must handle state intialization when transitioning and state tear down.
