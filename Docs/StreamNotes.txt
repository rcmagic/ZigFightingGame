2024/1/30 Special Move Motion Detection
=== Topics ===
- Review
- Detecting Motion inputs
    - Concept 
    - Examples (QCF, QCB, DP, Charge)
    - Solution
    - Implementation 
        - Extending the buffer
        - Motion data structure and encoding 
        - Updating action data to support motion conditions.
        - Motion detection
        - Limiting motion detection to when needed.
    - Potential Improvements
        - Detecting inline as needed
        - Detecting all motions each frame and recording last detected time
        - Relaxing motion input requirements
        - Kara canceling (Avoid delaying)
