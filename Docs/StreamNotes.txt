=== Topics ===
- Review
- Detecting Motion inputs
    - Concept 
    - Examples (QCF, QCB, DP, Charge)
    - Solution
    - Implementation 
        - Extending the buffer
        - Motion data structure and encoding 
        - Updating action data to support motion conditions.
        - Motion detection
        - Limiting motion detection to when needed.
    - Potential Improvements
        - Detecting inline as needed
        - Detecting all motions each frame and recording last detected time
        - Relaxing motion input requirements
        - Kara canceling (Avoid delaying)

2024/2/8 Launch Attacks, Launch Reactions and Juggling
- Launching Attacks (Launch Property)
    * Hit Y-Velocity 
    * Default launch gravity
    * Air knockback (X-Velocity)
- Launch Reaction
    * Turn off friction for air hits 
- Juggling (Air Combos)

- Add hit properties to json data
- Hook up hit properties in the collision system
- Hook up hit properties in the reaction system
- Hook up hit properties in reaction states

- Throws (Concepts)
- Throws Possible Implementations
- Implement Throws - Data structure
- Implement Throws - Behavior
- Implement Collisions.


How are throws different than attacks?
- Attacks cause a hit reaction when an opponent isn't blocking, but causes a block reaction when they are blocking.
- Throws cause the same reaction on hit or block.
- Hit reactions can be context dependent, but throw reactions are always the same.
- Throws lock the opponent into a state in which the thrower controls them.
- Thrower releases the throwee when the throw is finished.
- Throws are branching. On collision they perform the success action, on whiff they perform a whiff action.
