** Action State Machine **

*** Concepts ***
- There are actions. These actions are unique.
- A character can only be performing one action at a time (only can be in one state).
- An action has one or more animations that is played.
- In general, an "action state" or just "action" will execute until the end of the action's animation.
- Most actions will return to the "idle" state.
- The idle states (standing, crouching, jump, etc) transition into attacks and other actions "commanded" by the player.
