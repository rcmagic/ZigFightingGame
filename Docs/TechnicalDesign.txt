** Action State Machine **

*** Concepts ***
- There are actions. These actions are unique.
- A character can only be performing one action at a time (only can be in one state).
- An action has one or more animations that is played.
- In general, an "action state" or just "action" will execute until the end of the action's animation.
- Most actions will return to the "idle" state.
- The idle states (standing, crouching, jump, etc) transition into attacks and other actions "commanded" by the player.


*** Input Handling ***
- Player input is polled at the start of our game tick. 
- The change in input state needs to be stored somewhere which can be read by the game simulation.
- We going to store input once per game update (frame). This will let us replay inputs to produce
    exactly the same result for testing/replays/network syncronization.
- These stored input "commands" will drive character behavior.

** Character Controller **
- The character will be controlled by a state machine with unique states for each action.
- State transitions will represent changes from one action to another.
- Player control (player input) will trigger state transitions to the desired action.
